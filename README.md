# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-Nobel-Prizes-1901-2016-Dataset

### Overview
This project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Nobel Prizes (1901*2016) dataset. The aim is to analyze trends, patterns, and insights from Nobel Prize award data over the years. The analysis covers various aspects of the dataset, including laureates' achievements, award categories, and the distribution of prizes across different countries, ages, and disciplines.

### Objectives
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
   - Importing and preprocessing the Nobel Prizes dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Transforming data for better analysis and visualization.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing key metrics such as the number of awards per year, award distribution by category, and the geographical distribution of laureates.
   - Visualizing trends in Nobel Prize awards, including changes over time and patterns across different categories.
   - Investigating the gender distribution of laureates and exploring the impact of awards on various fields.
   - **Age Analysis**: Identifying patterns in the age distribution of Nobel Prize winners across different categories and periods.

3. **Key Insights**:
   - **Temporal Trends**:
     - Identified trends in the number of Nobel Prizes awarded over time and notable peaks or declines.
   - **Category Distribution**:
     - Analyzed the distribution of prizes across different categories (e.g., Peace, Literature, Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Economic Sciences) and how this has evolved.
   - **Geographical Insights**:
     - Mapped the geographical distribution of Nobel laureates, highlighting countries with the highest number of awards.
   - **Gender Analysis**:
     - Examined the gender distribution among laureates and identified any significant trends or disparities.
   - **Age Analysis**:
     - Investigated the age distribution of winners, revealing trends such as older laureates in more recent years and notable exceptions in the Peace category.
